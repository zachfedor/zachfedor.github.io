# Introduction

Welcome to the style guide and pattern library of my blog. I use an awesome tool called Astrum to turn my styles and markup into living documentation. Now I can add these components into the site when I need them using proper markup. If I ever add new style declarations, I can check here to see if they corrupt something else.

The patterns start with Atoms, the indivisible elements that make up a page. Next we have Molecules which start to show functionality. They are composed of multiple Atoms bound together. Finally, Organisms show a more complex interface by stitching Molecules together to show a page section.

Visit the rest of the site to see these patterns in action on the Pages that they were created for.
