_Disclaimer: I was an English major._

I love words. I love finding the perfect word to convey the proper meaning. However, everyone has a unique view of the words they use and hear. I think more arguments are caused due to a fundamental difference in terminology than from a difference of opinion. Alright, that's probably a hyperbole. But you get my point. Defining your terms is always a good idea.

So as a Developer, I want to explain my idea of Design.

Sure, this might be worse than opening Pandora's Box.
