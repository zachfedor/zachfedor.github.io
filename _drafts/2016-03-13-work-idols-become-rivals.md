This quote is a nice bit of advice to the ambitious. It connects the fact that you idolize someone because you think they are successful and therefore sublimes a specific goal out of an often enigmatic idea success. The path to that goal is yours to discover, but the end is clear: to be on the same playing field as those you admire. But this contains a major assumption that your idols are your idols because of the work they do or how they do it. So what if you idolize someone for all the work they do not do?

Anytime I read a piece of literature from the 18th or 19th centuries, I'm often struck by the seemingly endless supply of liesure time afforded to the characters. Often, these are men of capital. Whether inherited or worked for, the stories almost always take place after the hard part is over. These men wake early, write copious letters, meet with associates over cognac and cigars, and travel by boat or train to far off parts of the world to conduct their business. Yes this is work, but from the reader's point of view it is enviable.

I know I am viewing these men through a rose colored lens. They are fictional characters, of course, written by authors who often didn't get the success they were due until long after their death. I am not forgetting the coal soot, mud, or horse manure that covered everything in a city. I am not forgetting the frequent outbreaks of cholera, typhoid, or diptheria. I am not forgetting the wars and higher rate of crime. I am merely longing for modern equivalent to the style of work that was so common in the upper class of this era.

At the moment, I am not a man of capital. That seems to be the first and most obvious obstacle I face. As a laborer, I sell my time for a wage. I don't think I can attain any version of success while that is the case. 

Working less is not a new idea. [Books][] and [articles][] on the subject are published incessantly. A [Google search][google] for "work less" gets 2.9 Billion results. How many times does the thought cross your mind? I know I'm not alone.
