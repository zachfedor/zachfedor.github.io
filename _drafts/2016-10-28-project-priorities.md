I have a lot of side projects floating around my head right now. They are in various stages of started, anywhere from a few minutes of pipe dreaming to the beginnings of a code base that has been restarted four times already. Notably, none of these have gone farther than their start. Hopefully this exercise will fix that.

My goal for 2016 is to finish *one* of these. I need to figure out which one. I know I can do anything, but not everything. So I'm going to list out all of the ideas I feel like working on and dive into the reason behind them all. What problem am I trying to solve? What is the passion driving them? What is my priority?

Once I have my answer, I can truly focus on what is important to me. The others, regardless of the merit behind their conception, will have to wait.


## Vili

Vili is my attempt at the most usable time tracker ever:

- create a time tracking utility that i will actually use to get a better understanding of my own priorities (ironic, isn't it?)
- exercise my UI design skills
- learn isomorphic javascript with an api and multiple clients
- learn a modern javascript stack:
    - react (or ember)
    - react native (or swift)
    - redux (or ember-data)
    - webpack
- learn TDD/BDD

I originally had this at the top for many reasons which is why this project is the farthest along. Again, that's not saying much considering most of the others don't even have code yet. I've began this one four times but I haven't progressed that far. I think one of the problems holding me back is an attempt to learn too much at once.


## Waymark

Waymark is my replacement of vimwiki's workflow without the quirks of a custom markup:

- first attempt at vim plugin
- learn vimscript (or python or ruby)
- maintain a real open-source project

This project is fairly high in my priority list. I have some qualms with vimwiki and part of me thinks that I'd take more or better notes with a better tool. I know that's idealistic, but not terribly unrealistic either. I also like the idea of becoming a project maintainer and providing a useful utility to the community.


## Functional Programming

I've been working through SICP and other exercise materials to learn functional programming concepts. There is no deliverable project, just the attainment of a new paradigm of development. This will hopefully impact everything I do. Because the exercises are already created for me, it seems like a very good reward for very little effort.


## Blog

A site to encourage my writing and sharing it with others:

- write more!
- learn jekyll
- learn astrum and pattern libraries

This is high on the list mostly because of the confidence boost it gives. There isn't much to do in terms of upfront work, just polishing an existing site. That and the fact that its a chance to show off what I know. The real work lies in upkeep, continually adding new content to the blog. It's this last point that keeps this project off the very top. Continual effort for no other reward than self-improvement and introspection. Although, now that I say it like that, I wonder why it isn't higher because those are qualities that I value pretty highly. Maybe I fear the guilt that comes from starting this up and then letting it fall into disrepair. I've never been the best gardener.


## Bookmark

CLI cloud-synced utility for quickly capturing, storing, organizing, and retrieving

## Self-Hosted Cloud

A mix of cloud services to replace my dependence on third parties and allow finer control of my own data.

- file server
- git server
- mail server
- remote dev environment


## Hom

A site that I can use as a launchpad/dashboard/homepage. My very own aggregated list of bookmarks, news feeds, and random bits of info.


## Home Automation

A step beyond the self-hosted cloud project into the self-hosted home system. This is probably the lowest priority for many reasons:

- cost of devices
- don't own home
- lack of security
- lifestyle excess
