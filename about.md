Hi. My name is Zach Fedor and I'm a professional developer, an amateur philosopher, and an avid story teller. So I write about them, even if no one is listening...


## Other Stuff for the Curious

- I'm currently based out of [Lancaster, PA][lanc], a cool little city with a thriving [tech community][tl].
- I'm a developer at [Industrial Resolution][ir] where I make all sorts of web things. I like it. Here's [my resume][] if you're curious.
- I made [exemplify.io][exemplify] to help fellow dev agencies define acceptance for their user stories. And it's [open-source][gh-exemplify]!
- Here are some of the [tech presentations][slides] I've given at local meetups.
- Check out my [reading list][goodreads]. I'm always looking for recommendations!
