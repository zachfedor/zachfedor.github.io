Hi. My name is Zach Fedor and I'm a professional developer, a self-styled philosopher, and an avid story teller. I occasionally write about these things, even if no one is listening...


## Other Stuff for the Curious

- I'm based out of [Lancaster, PA][lanc], a cool little city with a thriving [tech community][tl].
- Recently, I was front-end engineer at [thehug.xyz][work] but I'm currently looking for work. Here's [my resume][]!
- You can look through some of my projects on [Github][] and [CodePen][].
- Here are some of the [presentations][slides] I've given at local tech meetups. Some are on [YouTube][yt].
