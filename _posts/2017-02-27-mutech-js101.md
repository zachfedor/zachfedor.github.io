I just finished giving my presentation at Millersville University's computer science club's monthly meeting so here are my slides!

- [Presentation Slides](http://slides.com/zachfedor/js-101#/)
- [Demo Source Code](https://github.com/zachfedor/mutech-js101)

Carlos asked me to do a talk on JavaScript that might complement a new required course for MU computer science majors. I was honored, and because I loved the [last presentation I gave there][atomic-design], I instantly accepted.

The class is an overview of building a web application and it's one of the only web-related courses so it's a lot to bite off for one semester. They cover databases, PHP, and HTML/CSS, but only JS if they can make time for it. Because Carlos is a pretty awesome club president, he wanted a talk to cover all the JavaScript things that this course might not get to.

Then again, he asked me to do the talk, so maybe we can't give him too much credit. ;)

Thanks again for having me, MUTech!
