Hey TechLancaster! Thanks for letting get nerdy about design systems!

[Slides if you want 'em](http://slides.com/zachfedor/atomic-design#/)

_Update:_ After the meetup, I was asked to give this presentation to Millersville's CS club. They are starting a monthly meetup to bring in a guest and talk about something outside their curriculum, which is pretty awesome if you ask me. Anyway, I was honored to give one of their first talks and plenty excited to rant a bit more about a topic I've been diving into pretty hard.

So here's a shout out to MUCS for the most fun I've ever had presenting at a meetup!
